# Web Development

## Web

### Web UI

#### [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

Bootstrap is a front end framework used to design responsive web pages and applications. It takes a mobile-first approach to web development, and includes pre-built CSS styles and classes, plus some JavaScript functionality.

In this course, you'll learn how to build responsive websites with Bootstrap, and use its included classes to style buttons, images, forms, navigation, and other common elements.

#### [jQuery](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/)

jQuery is one of the most widely used JavaScript libraries in the world.

In 2006 when it was released, all major browsers handled JavaScript slightly differently. jQuery simplified the process of writing client-side JavaScript, and also ensured that your code worked the same way in all browsers.

In this course, you'll learn how to use jQuery to select, remove, clone, and modify different elements on the page.

#### SASS

Sass, or "Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets", is a language extension of CSS. It adds features that aren't available in basic CSS, which make it easier for you to simplify and maintain the style sheets for your projects.

In this Sass course, you'll learn how to store data in variables, nest CSS, create reusable styles with mixins, add logic and loops to your styles, and more.


### Web HttpReqeust


[Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)

* Make XMLHttpRequests from the browser
* Make http requests from node.js
* Supports the Promise API
* Intercept request and response
* Transform request and response data
* Cancel requests

AJAX

>
`AJAX` = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.
>
>`AJAX` is not a programming language.
>
>`AJAX` just uses a combination of:

* A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
* JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)

jQuery AJAX

“Ajax” stands for Asynchronous Javascript And XML, jQuery provides a condensed format to make XMLHTTPRequest. AJAX is the art of exchanging data with a server and updating parts of a web page — without reloading the whole page.

* Cross-browser support
* Simple methods to use
* Define the type of request

jQuery ajax base syntax:

```
$.ajax({name:value, name:value, … })
$.ajax makes the call to ajax, then the methods are called in place of a name and the callbacks as value, as the example given below.
jQuery ajax Example:
```
